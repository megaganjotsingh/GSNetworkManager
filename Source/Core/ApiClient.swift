    /// A URL path component is a segment of the URL that follows the domain name, separated by "/". For instance, in "https://example.com/v1/user", the segments "v1" and "user" are path components.
    ///
    /// Specifying the path component as "/" allows the middleware to intercept every API call, applying global modifications or behaviors. This feature facilitates the application of diverse middleware logic on a per-path-segment basis, enabling precise control over request and response handling for different API endpoints.
    ///
    /// It's possible to associate multiple middleware with the same path component. They execute sequentially in the order they were added, enabling layered modifications or behaviors for the same URL path segment.
    ///
    /// Use this function to attach middleware for intercepting requests matching a specific URL path component. The middleware can perform various operations such as modifying requests before they're sent or processing responses after they're received.

    ///   - middleware: The `Middleware` instance encapsulating the path component target, pre-request callback, and post-response callback.

    ///   ```
    ///   let userPreRequestMiddleware = Middleware(pathComponent: "user", preRequestCallbak: { request in
    ///       // Modify the request, e.g., add a specific header
